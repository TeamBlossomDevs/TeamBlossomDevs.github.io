  <p>Hey funkBlog fans,</p>
<p>I’m Hundrec, the new Production Manager for the Funkin’ Crew. Nice to meet you!</p>
<p><a href="https://funkin.me/blog/2025-08-23/">As Abnormal recounted</a>, we went through quite the journey to join the Crew. Back in March, I wrote a blog to share a few stories about the fun stuff we encountered as GitHub moderators.</p>
<p>So let’s take a journey into the distant past, when 0.5.3 was the latest version and the Pit Stop 2 trailer just dropped, and explore the Funkin’ GitHub!<br><br><br></p>

<p>With the Pit Stop 2 update right around the corner, the contributors over at the Funkin’ GitHub repository have been real busy making the game better for you!</p>
<p>As a moderator for the repo, I’m excited to show you the ins and outs of our fun little community, and how you (yes, you!) can contribute to the development of the game!</p>
<h2 id="h2-what-is-the-funkin-github" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="what-is-the-funkin-github"></div>
    What is the Funkin’ GitHub?
  </h2>
  
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin">Funkin' GitHub repository</a> is the go-to place for reporting bugs and crashes, suggesting cool new features, and even contributing your own code to the game!</p>
<p>It’s also where all the game’s code is publicly stored, ready to be downloaded and compiled into your very own copy of Friday Night Funkin’ (hooray for open source!).</p>
<p>Although the repo has always been a fun place for bug-hunters and programmers, it hasn’t always been well-organized or easy to use. Since the release of the <a href="https://funkin.me/blog/2024-04-30/">Weekend 1 update</a>, the repo has gone through some <em>huge</em> changes.</p>
<h2 id="h2-mounting-problems" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="mounting-problems"></div>
    Mounting Problems
  </h2>
  
<p>It was May 9th, 2024.</p>
<p>Weekend 1 had been out for just over a week, and new issues were flooding in. Players were discovering a plethora of bugs and crashes from <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/2209">Null Object Reference</a> to <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/2384">Pico gone missing</a>. Lots of people were asking for help compiling the new v0.3.2 source code. Some issues were even reported multiple times!</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/compiling errors.png" style="width:1000px;"/>
</img>
<div align="center">
  <i><span>Compiling errors, coming in hot!</span></i><br><br>
</div>
<p>There were other glaring issues throughout the repo too. The bug report template was difficult to fill out, issues weren’t being reviewed and labeled, the README linked to a non-existent Contributor’s Guide…</p>
<p>The disorganization was getting out of hand. At this rate, the game’s programmers ninja_muffin99 and EliteMasterEric would have to spend more time sorting through hundreds of issues than fixing game-breaking bugs!</p>
<p>Fortunately, contributors from the Funkin’ GitHub community offered to help. Let’s take a look through some of the contributions that have made the repo as organized and user-friendly as it is today!</p>
<h2 id="h2-issue-templates" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="issue-templates"></div>
    Issue Templates
  </h2>
  
<p>When you report a bug or suggest a feature, you fill out an “issue template” with important information (e.g. game version, platform) that helps the developers understand your issue.</p>
<p>Back when Weekend 1 first released, our issue templates looked <em>awful</em>. They were overloaded with text, contained many spelling mistakes, and often confused users who just wanted to report <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/2830">a capital H</a>.</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/old issue template.png" style="width:900px;"/>
</img>
<div align="center">
  <i><span>Well, it’s got personality (much love to Cam!)</span></i><br><br>
</div>
<p>Even worse, all of the template’s instructions would be visible after submitting the issue.
This led to a lot of visual clutter and made it harder for the developers to review the growing backlog of active issues.</p>
<p>Thankfully, all of these problems were solved when community member <strong>tposejank</strong> introduced <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2717">fancy new templates</a> complete with clear instructions, a pre-submission checklist, and neat little dropdown menus!</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/issue checklist.png" style="width:900px;"/>
</img>
<div align="center">
  <i><span>Crystal clear!</span></i><br><br>
</div>
<p>Since then, the community has enjoyed a more streamlined and intuitive reporting experience. The submission instructions tell you exactly what to do and why you should do it, the checklist ensures the uniqueness and clarity of your issue, the dropdowns show you exactly what your options are, and the text fields are specifically tailored to each issue template. Huge upgrade!</p>
<h2 id="h2-the-moderation-team" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="the-moderation-team"></div>
    The Moderation Team
  </h2>
  
<p>Throughout 2024, Eric did the heavy lifting in the repo. He would add labels to categorize posts, reply to issues, review pull requests (code contributions), <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/3010#issuecomment-2224259967">accidentally close them all</a>, and clean up duplicate reports.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, it was incredibly difficult for one person to manage <strong>over 600 issues</strong> and 100+ pull requests, all while programming features for the next big update. That’s why, on January 21st, Eric invited <a href="https://github.com/AbnormalPoof">AbnormalPoof</a> and myself to become moderators for the Funkin’ GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/discussions/4016">Eric’s announcement</a>). With two people dedicated to cleaning up and maintaining issues and pull requests, Eric was finally free to focus on making the game!</p>
<p>Since Day 1, AbnormalPoof and I have worked hard to organize and revamp the whole repository. In less than two weeks, we managed to close <strong>over 200</strong> resolved and duplicate issues, bringing the total number of open issues from 600+ down to 458! And while that’s still a whole boatload, we’ve been actively managing new issues to ensure that number doesn’t break any records again.</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/January pulse.png" style="width:900px;"/>
</img>
<div align="center">
  <i><span>GitHub’s activity summary for January… we cleaned up big time!</span></i><br><br>
</div>
<p>On top of that, we’ve collaborated with Eric to carry out a project I’m very proud of to this day…</p>
<h2 id="h2-the-github-label-cleanup-proposal" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="the-github-label-cleanup-proposal"></div>
    The GitHub Label Cleanup Proposal
  </h2>
  
<p>Labels are important. Our repo uses them to categorize issues and pull requests (PRs, for short) by their status, type, topic, and other information. <br> For example, an issue/PR labeled <code>status: pending triage</code> hasn’t been reviewed, while an issue/PR labeled <code>status: rejected</code> won’t be added to the game.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2024, there was a growing labeling problem. Many issues had incorrect labels or no labels at all, the labels themselves were cluttered and inconsistent, and we had a bot running around marking things as “<a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/3942#issuecomment-2549923510">potential duplicate</a>” (it was wrong every time).</p>
<p>That’s why I opened <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/issues/3920">The GitHub Label Cleanup Proposal</a>, which detailed exactly how to clean up and organize the labels. Delete some here, create some there, group these together, change those colors, etc. etc.</p>
<p>It was a lot!</p>
<p>After some discussion and revision, Eric implemented all of the changes from the proposal.</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/label comparison.png" style="width:900px;"/>
</img>
<div align="center">
  <i><span>Our <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/labels">Labels list</a> before vs. after the Label Cleanup Proposal</span></i><br><br>
</div>
<p>The difference was night and day: the new labels were neatly categorized, colored consistently, and clearly defined. My favorite feature is the use of green and red to color labels indicating completion. You can now easily tell apart which issues are <code>status: resolved</code> (green) and which ones are <code>status: rejected</code> (red). How convenient!</p>
<p>With these huge changes, AbnormalPoof and I have made sure to label every issue and PR created since Weekend 1 released (almost 2000 in total). No more mystery issues :)</p>
<h2 id="h2-contributing-guide" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="contributing-guide"></div>
    Contributing Guide
  </h2>
  
<p>Many GitHub repos have a Contributing Guide to help new contributors learn the rules before opening their first issue or PR.</p>
<p>For the longest time, our Contributing Guide looked like this:</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/404 contributing guide.png" style="width:900px;"/>
</img>
<p>This wasn’t too big of a deal on its own, but the README introduction to the repo actually linked people to this guide. While this was pretty funny, it would have been nice to have an official resource for learning how to contribute to the development of the game.</p>
<p>Last month, AbnormalPoof and I got together to create just that. With feedback from Eric and <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/4133">the community</a>, we made sure to cover everything you should know before making your first contribution. Check out our brand new <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guide</a> to find out how you can make an impact on Friday Night Funkin’!</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m happy to report that the link in the README finally works :)</p>
<img src="/img/2025-09-19/contributing link.png" style="width:900px;"/>

    Wrap-up
  </h2>
  
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading about the history of the Funkin’ GitHub repo. I had a lot of fun writing about it!</p>
<p>You (that’s right, you!) are always welcome to drop by and contribute, so feel free to join the community. Whether you’re reporting bugs, suggesting new features, <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2508">fixing a typo</a>, or adding an entire <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3482">Stage Editor</a> (shoutout to <strong>KoloInDaCrib</strong>!), there’s something there for everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you on the <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin">Funkin’ GitHub</a> :)<br>

<p><span style="font-size:8px;">Hey!</span><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hey!</span><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:30px;">Hey!</span></b><br></p>
<p>Oh good, you’re finally awake. You’ve been mumbling about duplicate issues and Null Object Reference this whole time.<br>
I realized that I didn’t get a chance to tell you about what I do for the Crew now, so I’ll save that for another blog (or four).</p>
<p>For now, here’s a fun fact: Friday Night Funkin’ now has two independent streams of development!<br>
While the main programmers work on fresh new features for upcoming updates, the rest of us bring in bugfixes and optimizations from our contributors at the Funkin’ GitHub. So when we release new patches, rest assured that the next update is still on track.</p>
<p>Speaking of patches, we just released the 0.7.5 update!<br>
Here’s one change I love: GitHub contributors <a href="https://github.com/NotHyper-474">NotHyper-474</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KoloInDaCrib">KoloInDaCrib</a> ironed out every lagspike in Stress (Pico Mix) for a buttery smooth disgusting orange boy experience.</p>
<p>Check out the latest fixes in <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">the Changelog</a> and mobile store Release Notes!<br><br><br></p>
<p>But before you go grab the update, here’s a legendary song to sing along to:</p>
